# easy-file
A lightweight file handling utility for casually using C file streams

This is a simple header-only library for casual file handling applications. I created this as a way to explore deeper into the world of C file streams, while also allowing myself some neat little tools to better approach any file handling situations, especially for things such as [AOC](https://adventofcode.com/) and other code challenges.

## Quick Start

- Download the easy_file.h file into your local project
- Include the file into your project's C code after first defining the implementation
```c
#define EASY_FILE_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "easy_file.h"
```
